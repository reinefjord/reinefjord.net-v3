      <h1>This website</h1>
      <small><time>2022-05-09</time></small>

      <p>My personal website has gone through
      <a href="https://github.com/reinefjord/website">multiple</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/reinefjord/reinefjord.net-v2">iterations</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/reinefjord/reinefjord.net-v3">this</a>
      being the third version. The first one was a relatively simple Flask
      app. The second one looked very similar to this one but had a Bash script
      to compile CSS and cache bust static CSS and JS files, in practice a very
      simple static site generator.</p>

      <p>This one is just plain HTML files, written by hand, with CSS and JS
      inline if needed. It is an exercise in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keeping it simple, stupid</a>,
      an experiment to see if the site evolves with time, and a way to satisfy
      my longing for a time when the internet was less corporations and more
      personal. It also helps that I really like simple, brutalist "design" in
      web pages.</p>

      <p>Having CSS and JavaScript inline hopefully means that this isolated
      page should keep working even if other parts of the website change.
      That's the "evolving" part. When I want to create a new page, I'll just
      copy another page and just replace the content. This page is copied from
      the index.html for example. Or I'll create a page from scratch.
      Consistency is boring anyway, and I'm free to style every page however I
      see fit.</p>

      <p>I've deliberately made it available over both HTTP and HTTPS without
      redirection from one to the other. I want this website to be available
      through even the most basic means. If you do need to use HTTPS to
      prevent your ISP from injecting ads or some other reason, you can.</p>

      <p>Being able to do this makes me happy, though:</p>
